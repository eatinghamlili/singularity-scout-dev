"""Builds the website's index.html from the scouting board page (alliance-pick-board.html).

The board was first made as a claude.ai page. This script turns it into a normal website:
  * the page loads Supabase + platform.js instead of relying on claude.ai features
  * FTCScout is fetched straight from the visitor's browser (no desktop app needed)
  * every signed-in scout's browser keeps rankings updated during a competition
  * leads (from the roster) do what the board owner did on claude.ai
  * claude.ai-only wording is replaced and the AI recap is hidden

TEST COPY: edit src/board.html, then run:   python tools/build-site.py
